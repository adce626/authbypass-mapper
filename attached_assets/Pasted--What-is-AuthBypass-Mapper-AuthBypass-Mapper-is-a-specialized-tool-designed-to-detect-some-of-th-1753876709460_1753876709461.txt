🧠 What is AuthBypass Mapper?

AuthBypass Mapper is a specialized tool designed to detect some of the most dangerous, widespread, and high-impact vulnerabilities in the bug bounty field:

✅ Authentication Bypass vulnerabilities
✅ Privilege Escalation issues
✅ IDOR/BOLA hidden behind authentication

🎯 Tool Objective:

“To simulate different authentication bypass scenarios automatically, analyze the server responses using AI, and detect signs of successful bypass.”

🔎 What exactly does the tool do?

Stage	What Happens
1️⃣ Request Collection	Parses real traffic from HAR or Burp Suite files (.har, .xml)
2️⃣ Attack Generation	Modifies requests: removes tokens, alters headers/cookies, etc.
3️⃣ Request Execution	Sends all modified versions to the server, logs responses
4️⃣ Diff Analysis	Compares each response to the original: changes in status, page content, redirection
5️⃣ AI (GPT) Analysis	AI reviews the response and gives a verdict like: “Possible Auth Bypass”

🤖 How does AI (like GPT) help?

AI is used to:

Understand the response content (HTML/JSON).

Detect success indicators like:

"user_id": 1

Text such as "Welcome back!"

Redirects to /dashboard

Presence of sensitive info like emails, tokens

Suggest further attacks (e.g., Privilege Escalation, IDOR testing)

🧪 Types of Bypass Experiments Conducted:

Test	Purpose
🔓 Remove Authorization header	Does the app allow access without auth?
🧪 Change JWT to null or invalid	Is there real JWT validation happening?
🛠️ Change role=user → role=admin	Test simple privilege escalation
🪪 Swap session_id to another user	Check for IDOR/BOLA
🔁 Modify X-Forwarded-For	Try to trick the proxy or bypass IP filters

🖼️ Example Output:

pgsql

[Request #3]
→ Original: 302 Redirect to /login
→ Modified: 200 OK - Access Granted

[AI Analysis]:
- Response includes keyword: "Welcome, admin"
- JSON response contains: "user_role": "admin"
- Potential Authentication Bypass – Critical

→ Suggested Manual Follow-up: Try accessing /admin/settings
📦 Tool Output:

results.json: Stores all test attempts, success/failure, and AI verdict

(Planned) Simple HTML report with GUI

Direct links to successful bypass attempts

🔗 Tool Integration with Others:

Tool	How it Integrates
JSFlow AI	Uses discovered API endpoints to test for bypasses
ReconGPT	Identifies login pages and feeds them to this tool
Report Generator (Future)	Automatically documents successful exploits
