## System Architecture

### Core Architecture Pattern
The application follows a modular pipeline architecture where each component handles a specific stage of the vulnerability detection process:

1. **Input Processing**: HAR/Burp Suite file parsing
2. **Attack Generation**: Request modification for bypass testing
3. **Request Execution**: HTTP request sending and response capture
4. **Response Analysis**: Differential analysis between original and modified responses
5. **AI Analysis**: GPT-4o powered intelligent vulnerability assessment

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python 3
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o API
- **HTTP Client**: requests library with custom session management
- **File Formats**: HAR (HTTP Archive) and Burp Suite XML parsing
- **Output**: JSON-based results with timestamped files

## Key Components

### 1. HAR Parser (`har_parser.py`)
**Purpose**: Extracts HTTP requests from HAR files and Burp Suite XML exports
**Key Features**:
- Supports both HAR and Burp Suite formats
- Domain filtering capabilities
- Request detail extraction and normalization

### 2. Bypass Generator (`bypass_generator.py`)
**Purpose**: Creates authentication bypass attack vectors by modifying original requests
**Attack Types**:
- Authorization header removal
- JWT token manipulation
- Session cookie removal
- Parameter modification
- Header injection

### 3. Request Sender (`request_sender.py`)
**Purpose**: Handles HTTP request execution with proper error handling and retry logic
**Features**:
- Session management with SSL verification disabled for testing
- Configurable timeouts and retry mechanisms
- Comprehensive error handling

### 4. Response Analyzer (`response_analyzer.py`)
**Purpose**: Performs differential analysis between original and modified responses
**Analysis Types**:
- Status code changes
- Content differences
- Redirect behavior changes
- Header modifications
- Content length variations

### 5. AI Analyzer (`ai_analyzer.py`)
**Purpose**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4o to provide intelligent vulnerability assessment
**Capabilities**:
- Context-aware response analysis
- Severity classification
- Bypass detection with confidence scoring
- Recommendation generation

### 6. Main Controller (`main.py`)
**Purpose**: Orchestrates the entire vulnerability detection pipeline
**Features**:
- Command-line interface
- Output directory management
- Results compilation and reporting
- Summary generation

## Data Flow

1. **Input Stage**: HAR/Burp files are parsed to extract legitimate HTTP requests
2. **Authentication Detection**: Requests are analyzed for authentication indicators (tokens, headers, cookies)
3. **Attack Generation**: Multiple bypass variants are created for each authenticated request
4. **Execution Stage**: Both original and modified requests are sent to target servers
5. **Comparison**: Responses are compared using differential analysis techniques
6. **AI Assessment**: GPT-4o analyzes response differences to determine potential vulnerabilities
7. **Output**: Results are compiled into timestamped JSON reports with severity classifications

## External Dependencies

### Required APIs
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4o model access for intelligent response analysis
- **Target Web Applications**: HTTP endpoints being tested for vulnerabilities

### Python Libraries
- `requests`: HTTP client for sending requests
- `openai`: OpenAI API client
- `json`: Data serialization
- `xml.etree.ElementTree`: XML parsing for Burp Suite files
- `urllib3`: URL handling and SSL warning suppression

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for AI analysis functionality

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
The tool is designed to run as a standalone Python application with minimal setup requirements:

1. Install required dependencies
2. Set OpenAI API key as environment variable
3. Run via command line with HAR/Burp files as input

### Key Design Decisions

**Modular Architecture**: Each component is isolated with clear interfaces, allowing for easy testing and maintenance of individual pipeline stages.

**AI Integration Choice**: GPT-4o was selected for its advanced reasoning capabilities in understanding HTTP response contexts and identifying subtle bypass indicators that traditional rule-based systems might miss.

**File Format Support**: Both HAR and Burp Suite XML formats are supported to accommodate different workflow preferences and toolchains used by security researchers.

**Error Handling Strategy**: Comprehensive error handling ensures the tool continues operation even when individual requests fail, maximizing the coverage of vulnerability testing.

**Output Format**: JSON output with timestamps provides machine-readable results that can be integrated into larger security testing pipelines or imported into other tools.

The architecture prioritizes reliability, extensibility, and accuracy in vulnerability detection while maintaining simplicity in deployment and usage.
